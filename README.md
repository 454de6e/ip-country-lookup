# ip-country-lookup

https://codesandbox.io/s/github/454de6e/ip-country-lookup

This CodeSandbox explores the use of [`apollo-client`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) to read remote data from a GraphQL API and local data from its cache.

It is based on [this Egghead lesson](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-zero-config-apollo-graphql-with-apollo-boost) with changes made to reflect Apollo's newer API using render components.
